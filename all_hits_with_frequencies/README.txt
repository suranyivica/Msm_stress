The frequencies of hits for each sample are presented here along with the frequencies of the same genomic variation occurrence of every other strains.
Please note that the hits presented in the samples are also represented in the ancestor strain 'APAW1' and many other different stress treated samples or in Mock samples.


These samples were renamed as following:
CombA2 = CombAna2
CombA3 = CombAna3
CombAu1 = CombAnare1
CombAu3 = CombAnare3
CombAu5 = CombAnare5
